# Create Async Thunk Adapter
This project is a quick spike of combining the `createAsyncThunk` and `createEntityAdapter` apis from @reduxjs/toolkit to create a reusable `createAsyncThunkAdapter` function.

## Running
This project was scaffolded using create-react-app.  To run it:
- open a console in project root.
- run `yarn install`.
- run `yarn start`.

This will automatically open a browser with the app running.
